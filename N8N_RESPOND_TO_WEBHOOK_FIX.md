# N8N "Respond to Webhook" Configuration Fix

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED

Your n8n workflow is returning ONLY the plain text, NOT the JSON object!

**What's happening**:
- Your Code node creates the correct format
- But "Respond to Webhook" node is NOT sending it correctly
- App receives plain text instead of JSON

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Fix "Respond to Webhook" Node

### Step 1: Open Your Workflow in N8N

### Step 2: Find the "Respond to Webhook" Node

This node is usually the LAST node in your workflow, connected after your Code node.

### Step 3: Configure It Correctly

Click on the "Respond to Webhook" node and set:

**Option A: Using "Respond With JSON"**
1. **Respond**: "Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node"
2. **Response Mode**: "Last Node"
3. **Response Data**: "First Entry JSON"

OR

**Option B: Using "Return All"** (Recommended)
1. Delete the "Respond to Webhook" node entirely
2. Your Code node will automatically return its output

---

## 🔧 Better Solution: Remove "Respond to Webhook" Node

N8N automatically returns the output of the last node!

### Steps:

1. **Delete** the "Respond to Webhook" node (if you have one)
2. Make sure your **Code node** is the last node
3. The Code node's return value will be sent as the webhook response

Your Code node already returns:
```javascript
return {
  success: true,
  query_id: webhookData.query_id,
  response_id: webhookData.response_id,
  response_data: formattedText,
  execution_time: 1234
}
```

This is EXACTLY what the app needs!

## 📋 Workflow Structure Should Be:

```
┌─────────────┐
│   Webhook   │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  Your API   │
│    Call     │
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│ Code Node   │  ← THIS IS THE LAST NODE!
│  (Format)   │     Returns JSON object
└─────────────┘
```

**DO NOT** have "Respond to Webhook" after the Code node!

---

## 🧪 Test After Fix:

1. Save the workflow
2. Click "Execute Workflow"
3. Check the output - should see JSON object, not plain text
4. Go back to your app and submit a query

---

## ⚠️ If You MUST Keep "Respond to Webhook" Node:

If for some reason you need to keep it, configure it like this:

1. **Response Mode**: "Last Node"
2. **Response Data**: "First Entry JSON"
3. Make sure it's connected AFTER your Code node

But honestly, **just delete it** - it's not needed!

---

## 🎯 Expected Result:

When you test the workflow in n8n, the FINAL output should be:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "response_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
  "response_data": "Google Search Results for: \"...\"\n\n═══...",
  "execution_time": 1234
}
```

NOT just:
```
Title: Element...
```

---

## 🔍 How to Verify:

### In N8N:
1. Execute the workflow
2. Look at the "Output" tab
3. Should show a JSON object with all fields

### From Your App:
1. Check browser Network tab (F12 → Network)
2. Find the request to n8n webhook
3. Look at the Response
4. Should be JSON, not plain text

**Fix both workflows (Google Search AND Google AI Mode) the same way!**
